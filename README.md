Imports:
we are using some external libraries: re for checking password strength using regular expressions, time for simulating delays (e.g., for updates), and colorama for making the output more colorful.
Notifications:
We need a way to send notifications to the admin. Instead of printing everything right away, we collect the notifications in a list (notifications) and show them at the end.
The send_notification() function simulates this by adding a message to the list of notifications.
Password Strength Checking:
We want to make sure users create strong passwords. The check_password_strength() function checks if the password is long enough and has numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters.
If the password is weak, we prompt the user to choose a stronger one using prompt_for_stronger_password().
Update Notifications:
We simulate the system automatically checking for updates (e.g., password or software updates) using check_for_updates().
If updates are available, the admin is notified that the system is applying these updates using notify_admin_of_updates().
Network Segmentation Recommendations:
Depending on how sensitive an IoT device is (low, medium, or high), we give recommendations on network segmentation using recommend_network_segmentation().
The admin is the only one who sees these recommendations.
Least Privilege Rule:
We apply the principle of least privilege to restrict access based on the user's role (admin, user, or guest) using apply_least_privilege().
Admins get full access, users get limited access, and guests are told to contact the admin for more information.
Displaying Notifications:
Finally, we display all the collected notifications for the admin using display_notifications().
Main Function:
The main() function ties everything together. It asks the user for their role (admin, user, or guest), their password, and for admin users, it provides updates and network segmentation recommendations.
